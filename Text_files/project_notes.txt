1: read values
2: place into 'grid' across
3: create 'grid' downwards -- declared, will be with 0 init
4: create grid block -- declared, will be with 0 init
5: count how many of each value already completed in grid -- yes and popping out completed items
6: set these values into dictionary, eg: {1:3, 2:1, 3:3} -- yes
7: find most placements but not completed. as per above, 2 -- yes
Start with if only one missing value in across, down or block, complete that.
8: find where 2 is missing by running through line x until no 2 is found.
9: run through line y until no 2 is found
10: run through 'block' until no 2 is found (to be created as 'stright line')
11: place 2 in open space, if only one option, else place in possibiliies list
12: update value in dictionary count
13: repeat from step 5 until puzzle is solved.
