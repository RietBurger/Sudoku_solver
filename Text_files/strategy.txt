1) find all empty spaces
2) find all possible allocations from 1 to 9 and place in list/array
3) go through list of possible allocations and see if only one number in possible allocation at any point xy
    	- if yes, allocate this number and restart from step 1
        - else, find if only one possibble allocation in a block at xy
